This project is about creating your very first game!

1. find your game assets. I found mine here:
https://www.gameart2d.com/freebies.html

2. resize your images using the apple software preview 
best resize all the images in the same size (32 x 32 or 100 x 100 pixels)

3. transform the resized images into xpm files online:

4. start researching and coding. A good intro offers this website:

for more info on the approach, check out the wiki section of this page.
